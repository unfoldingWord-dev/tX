# Translation Converter (tx)

This tool provides a number of RESTful services for
processing and publishing translations on the [Door43 Content Service](https://git.door43.org).

# Development

All of the development commands have been place in a make file for easy use.

* `make` or `make doc` generate the documentation.
* `make dependencies` install the dependencies.
* `make test` run the tests.
* `make run` starts the development server.

# Documentation

All methods and modules **must** be documented with reStructured text.
These doc strings will be used to generate the documentation files.
